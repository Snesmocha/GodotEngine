Color
The color tag [` allows you to dynamically change the color, mid line.
You can use hexadecimal HTML notation to assign color or you can use a predefiend shortcut code from the list below. (Note: Named colors or HSL will not work only hex codes) For example these are all valid color codes:

#f03c15 #f03c15 could be written as [`f03c15] or [`#f03c15]
#c5f015 #c5f015 could be written as [`c5f015] or [`#c5f015]
#1589F0 #1589F0 could be written as [`1589F0] or [`#1589F0]

Speed
The speed tag [*x] (where x is the speed or shortcut code value) allows you to change the speed the text 'types' out on the screen.
You can use '**' to set a custom speed, lower the number the faster the text printing would be. For example, '[**0.1]', '[**1]', '[**1e-3]' are all valid. You can also use the tags listed below for fast reference.

[*1] - Fastest
[*2] - Fast
[*3] - "Normal" (i think its p slow tbh)
[*4] - Slow
[*5] - Slowest
[*i] - Start instant print
[*n] - End instant and return to default speed

If you want all text to print out instantly, consider checking the 'Instant Text' option in the inspector.

Position
[^t] - Tipsy
[^d] - Drunk

Pause

[t#] - Pause for # tenths of a second

Font
An unlimited amount of alternate fonts can be used and configured in the inspector. To swap between them use the font tag [%x], where x is the index of the font you want to switch to. For examples look at the list below

[%0] - Switch to the 1st alternative font
[%1] - Switch to the 2nd alternative font
...
[%99] - Switch to the 100th alternative font
[%r] - Reset the font back to default
