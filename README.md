so in a nutshell

early access engine


don't use without perms

yes


a few more rules due to the license i am using

you cannot change the logo that is used here without explicid permision

you cannot use the engines code for general games without open sourcing unless you have me or cherry's specific permision to do so

you must credit syndibox, scene manager, and the guy who made the git hub addon

failing to do any of these will result in your game being taken down with full legal rights
